# DATASET848_mirco_Doppler_maps
 Provides a publicly available dataset of micro-Doppler feature maps.

# Dataset_848
The data was collected in nine different locations between 2017 and 2019, with 106 volunteers from the University of Glasgow, a north Glasgow elderly care home, and Age UK West Cumbria contributing.The dataset consists of
six motions: walking, sitting down, standing up, picking up an object, drinking water
and falling.

# Dataset_848_test
Conversion of raw radar data into micro-Doppler features maps.Due to the large size of the raw radar data, which is not conducive to uploading, a download address is provided as follows https://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/848/

# Dataset_848_cutting
The redundant information such as the axes of the micro-Doppler feature map is reduced for ease of use.
Due to my research needs, I then resized all the cropped maps to 224 x 224
